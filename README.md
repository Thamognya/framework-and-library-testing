# Library and Framework Testing

In this repo I test out a few libraries and framework, write a few notes on them for future use.

as of now I am starting/working on/done with:
- django (py) (I will work on doing django + nextjs after these in the todo)
- Drogon (cpp)
- rocket.rs (rs) (I will work on rocket + yew after the todo)
- artix (rs)
