# Django

A python based web framework that is very popular (used in mozilla, open stack and etc.)

## My opinions

Altough I did not even scratch the full potential of django in my 1 hour testing time nor am I a professional, here is my 2 cents:

- I really like the language used since python is a intutive language, and one that I really like
- Easy url management

Overall for me I would use it with nextjs frontend which will for me atleast give a score of 9/10. It is my current favorite framework.
