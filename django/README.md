# Django

A python based web framework that is very popular (used in mozilla, open stack and etc.)

## My opinions

- I really like the language used since python is a intutive language, and one that I really like
- Easy url management

Overall for me I would use it with nextjs frontend which will for me atleast give a score of 9/10. It is my current favorite framework.
