# Drogon

if I am not wrong, this is currently the fastest framework (atleast drogon-core). So in that regards it is extremly quick. Also it uses c++ which allows for c code hence making it right at home for the osdevs and c/c++ users.


## My opinions

Altough I did not even scratch the full potential of drogon in my 1 hour testing time nor am I a professional, here is my 2 cents:

I will do this later, as it is a bit hard.

## Benefits
- fast
- uses c/c++

### Cons
- a bit hard
- everything has it cons, you can find that out yourselfs; besides choose the framework you like not my opinon.
